### Quality Assurance
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Code Review**: Pull request reviews with automated checks
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for high-traffic scenarios
- **Security Auditing**: Regular security assessments and dependency updates

## Challenges Overcome

### Payment Processing Complexity
Integrating Stripe required careful handling of:
- **PCI Compliance**: Ensuring secure handling of payment data
- **Webhook Processing**: Reliable event handling for payment confirmations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of payment failures and edge cases
- **Refund Processing**: Implementing partial and full refund capabilities

**Solution**: Implemented robust webhook handling with idempotency checks, comprehensive error logging, and fallback mechanisms for payment processing failures.

### Inventory Management
Managing real-time inventory across multiple sales channels presented challenges:
- **Concurrent Updates**: Preventing overselling during high traffic
- **Stock Reservations**: Holding inventory during checkout process
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of large inventory updates
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining accuracy across cache and database

**Solution**: Implemented database transactions with row-level locking, Redis-based inventory caching with TTL, and background jobs for bulk operations.

### Performance Optimization
Achieving fast load times with large product catalogs required:
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization and proper indexing
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data
- **Image Optimization**: Efficient image delivery and lazy loading
- **API Optimization**: Pagination, field selection, and query optimization

**Solution**: Implemented database query optimization, Redis caching for product data, CDN for image delivery, and GraphQL-style field selection for API responses.
