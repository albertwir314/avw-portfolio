## Development Process

### Requirements Analysis
Conducted extensive research into existing task management solutions to identify gaps and opportunities:
- **User Interviews**: Spoke with project managers and developers about pain points
- **Competitive Analysis**: Analyzed features and limitations of popular tools
- **Use Case Definition**: Defined primary and secondary use cases for different user types
- **Feature Prioritization**: Created roadmap based on user value and technical complexity

### Design & Planning
- **User Experience Design**: Created wireframes and prototypes for key workflows
- **API Design**: Designed RESTful API with clear resource relationships
- **Database Design**: Optimized schema for performance and scalability
- **Architecture Planning**: Designed system architecture for real-time collaboration

### Implementation Strategy
Followed agile development practices with two-week sprints:

1. **MVP Development**: Core task CRUD operations and basic UI
2. **Collaboration Features**: Real-time updates and team functionality
3. **Advanced Features**: Reporting, analytics, and workflow automation
4. **Polish & Optimization**: Performance tuning and user experience improvements

## Technical Challenges

### Real-Time Collaboration
Implementing real-time updates across multiple users required careful consideration:

**Challenge**: Maintaining data consistency when multiple users edit simultaneously
**Solution**: Implemented operational transformation for conflict resolution and optimistic updates with rollback capabilities

**Challenge**: Scaling WebSocket connections for large teams
**Solution**: Used Redis pub/sub for WebSocket scaling and implemented connection pooling

### Performance Optimization
Handling large datasets and complex queries efficiently:

**Challenge**: Slow query performance with large task databases
**Solution**: Implemented database indexing strategy, query optimization, and pagination for large result sets

**Challenge**: Real-time updates causing UI performance issues
**Solution**: Implemented virtual scrolling for large lists and debounced updates to prevent excessive re-renders

### Complex Permission System
Building flexible role-based access control:

**Challenge**: Granular permissions for different project roles
**Solution**: Implemented hierarchical permission system with project-level and organization-level roles

## Key Features Implementation

### Real-Time Updates
```python
# WebSocket endpoint for real-time task updates
@app.websocket("/ws/project/{project_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, project_id: int):
    await websocket.accept()
    # Subscribe to project updates
    await redis.subscribe(f"project:{project_id}")
    
    try:
        while True:
            # Listen for updates and broadcast to connected clients
            message = await redis.get_message()
            if message:
                await websocket.send_json(message['data'])
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        await redis.unsubscribe(f"project:{project_id}")
```

### Advanced Filtering
Implemented flexible filtering system that allows users to create complex queries:
- **Multiple Criteria**: Combine filters with AND/OR logic
- **Saved Filters**: Save frequently used filter combinations
- **Quick Filters**: One-click filters for common scenarios
- **Search Integration**: Full-text search combined with structured filters
