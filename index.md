      Currently, I am working for <a href="https://www.shorecapitalpartners.com/" target="_blank">Shore Capital Partners</a> as a Senior Data Engineer. I work with our portfolio companies to unify their data to enable better automated company performance tracking. This creates organic growth within these organizations and enables their data for AI/ML use cases in the future. In addition to this, I build out internal platforms and create standardization for the companies' new data practice.

      I received my B.S. in Material Science and Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Throughout my time here, I honed in on skills in both the computational and physical sciences. My past work has mainly revolved around the build out of data systems to enable high impact utilization of data in AI/ML use cases and KPI tracking.
